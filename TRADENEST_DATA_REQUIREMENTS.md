- Mix of all 4 types (price_spike, tariff_change, freight_surge, fx_volatility)
- Mix of all 4 severities (low, medium, high, critical)
- Distributed over past 30-90 days
- Link to diverse products
- Include some null product_id anomalies (freight, FX)
```

### PRIORITY 2: Custom Rules Data (For Rules Page)

- Price change detection
- Volume spike detection
- Geographic pattern detection
- Time-based patterns
- Multi-factor rules
```

### PRIORITY 3: Intelligence Usage Data (For Intelligence Page)
```typescript
// Generate usage records:
- Connection analyses
- Multi-hop analyses
- Temporal analyses
- Different users (if multi-user)
- Different time windows
```

### PRIORITY 4: More Shipments (For Trade Intelligence)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Add This Data

### Option 1: Extend Existing Seed Script
Modify `lib/mock-data/seed.ts` to:
1. Increase anomaly generation (currently generates 10, should generate 100+)
2. Add custom rules generation
3. Add user subscription seeding
4. Add intelligence usage tracking

### Option 2: Create Additional Seed Scripts
Create:
- `scripts/seed-custom-rules.js` - Add custom rules
- `scripts/seed-intelligence-usage.js` - Add usage tracking
- `scripts/seed-more-anomalies.js` - Generate 100+ anomalies
- `scripts/seed-subscriptions.js` - Add subscription tiers

### Option 3: Use Supabase SQL Editor
Manually insert sample data directly via SQL

## üìã Summary Checklist

To fully demonstrate TradeNest capabilities:

- [x] Products - ‚úÖ Has 50 products
- [x] Price Data - ‚úÖ Has ~5,400 records
- [x] Tariff Data - ‚úÖ Has tariff history
- [x] FX Rates - ‚úÖ Has FX data
- [x] Freight Index - ‚úÖ Has freight data
- [x] Companies - ‚úÖ Has 500+ companies
- [x] Ports - ‚úÖ Has Malaysian ports
- [x] Shipments - ‚ö†Ô∏è Has 800, needs 2000+
- [x] Gazettes - ‚ö†Ô∏è Has some data
- [ ] Anomalies - ‚ùå Needs 90+ more (currently only 10)
- [ ] Alerts - ‚ùå Needs 90+ more (currently only 10)
- [ ] Custom Rules - ‚ùå NEEDS 10-20 rules
- [ ] Rule Executions - ‚ùå NEEDS execution history
- [ ] User Subscriptions - ‚ùå NEEDS subscription data
- [ ] Intelligence Usage - ‚ùå NEEDS usage tracking

---

## üöÄ Quick Start to Fix This

### Run These Commands:
```bash
# 1. Clear existing anomalies/alerts
psql -d your_db -c "DELETE FROM alerts; DELETE FROM anomalies;"

# 2. Run enhanced seed script (to be created)
node scripts/seed-more-anomalies.js

# 3. Run custom rules seed
node scripts/seed-custom-rules.js

# 4. Run subscription seed
node scripts/seed-subscriptions.js

# 5. Run intelligence usage seed
node scripts/seed-intelligence-usage.js
```

### Or: Update Main Seed Script
Modify `lib/mock-data/seed.ts` to generate 10x more data:
- Change from 10 to 100+ anomalies
- Add custom rules generation
- Add subscription seeding
- Add usage tracking

---

**Bottom Line**: TradeNest needs ~90 more anomalies, custom rules data, and intelligence usage tracking to fully showcase all features. The existing data is good for basic features, but to show the full platform's capabilities, you need additional seed data.
