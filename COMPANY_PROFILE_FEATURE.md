## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **API Endpoint** (`app/api/companies/[id]/route.ts`)

A comprehensive REST API that fetches and aggregates company trade data:

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/companies/[id]` - Get complete company profile with all stats

**Returns:**
- Company basic info (name, country, type, sector)
- Statistics (total shipments, value, products, routes, dates)
- Top products by HS code
- Top carriers/vessels
- Shipping activity over time (monthly)
- Activity feed from recent shipments
- Country distribution

**Key Features:**
- Uses existing database functions (`get_company_stats`)
- Aggregates shipment data automatically
- Calculates percentages for visualizations
- Handles missing data gracefully

### 2. **Company Profile Page** (`app/companies/[id]/page.tsx`)

A beautiful, Panjiva-inspired dashboard that displays:

#### **Header Section**
- Company name with building icon
- Location badge with map pin
- Type and sector information

2. **Total Value** - Sum of all shipment values
3. **Products** - Number of unique products (HS codes)
4. **Routes** - Number of unique trade routes
5. **First Shipment** - Earliest shipment date

#### **Activity Feed** (Left Column)
- Timeline-style list of recent activities
- Date-stamped events from shipments
- "See all activities" button
- Scrollable with max height

#### **Charts & Products** (Middle Column)
- **Shipping Activity Chart**: Line chart showing shipments over time (12 months)
- **Top Products**: List of top 5 products by shipment volume with:
  - HS code and description
  - Shipment count
  - Percentage bar indicators

#### **Trading Partners & Carriers** (Right Column)
- **Top Suppliers**: Trading partners (currently placeholder)
- **Top Customers**: End customers (currently placeholder)

### 3. **Navigation Integration** (`app/dashboard/trade-intelligence/page.tsx`)

Added clickable company names in the Trade Intelligence table:

**Before:**
```
| Company         |
| Panadol Sdn Bhd |
```

**After:**
```
| Company                      |
| [Panadol Sdn Bhd] (clickable)|
```

Clicking a company name navigates to `/companies/[company_id]` for full profile.
