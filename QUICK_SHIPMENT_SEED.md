# Quick Fix: Adding Shipment Data

## Issue
Company profiles are showing 0 shipments because the seed process didn't generate any shipment records.

## Solution

The API now handles empty shipments gracefully. To add real shipment data:

### Option 1: Clear and Re-seed (Recommended)

Visit: http://localhost:3000/setup

1. Click **"Clear Database"**
2. Click **"Seed Database"**

This should generate shipments if the seeding logic is working.

### Option 2: Check What Happened

Check your browser's developer console when you clicked "Seed Database" - look for any error messages about shipments.

### Option 3: Manual SQL Insert (Quick Fix)

Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Check current shipment count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shipments;

-- If 0, the shipment generation likely failed during seeding
-- The seed.ts code expects shipments array but it might be empty
```

### What I Fixed

✅ Company profile API now handles 0 shipments gracefully
✅ Returns empty arrays instead of erroring
✅ You can view company profiles even without shipment data
✅ Shows "No product data available" instead of crashing

## Test Now

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/companies
2. Click any company
3. You should see the profile page without errors
4. Stats will show "0" for all metrics until shipment data is added
