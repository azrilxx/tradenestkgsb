## üéØ Strategic Rationale: Why These 3 Modules?

### Why NOT all 9 modules?
- **Time-to-funding:** 3 modules = 2-3 weeks vs 9 modules = 6+ months
- **Focus over breadth:** Deep implementation > surface-level features
- **Prove scalability:** Show architectural flexibility without over-engineering

### Why THESE 3 modules?
1. **Company Drill-Down:** Addresses #1 investor question: "Can this scale beyond alerts?"
2. **Benchmarks:** Shows you have market intelligence (competitor parity with Panjiva)
3. **Custom Rules:** Demonstrates platform flexibility (appeals to enterprise buyers)

### What comes AFTER funding?
- Modules 4-9 become your **Series A roadmap**
- Hire dev team to execute parallel tracks
- Add real data integrations (UN Comtrade, Freightos APIs)
- Build Python FastAPI microservices for heavy analytics
