   - Transform to TradeNest schema
   - Deduplicate across sectors

3. **Seed Database**
   - Upload to companies table
   - Categorize by sector
   - Tag as MATRADE-verified

**Expected Output:**

### **Phase 2: Trade Statistics Integration** (Week 2)

**Goal:** Generate realistic shipment data based on actual trade patterns

**Steps:**
1. **Download Trade Flow Datasets**
   - Export/Import by geographical region
   - Export/Import by product (SITC)
   - Major destinations/sources

2. **Analyze Historical Patterns**
   - Top trading partners (China, Singapore, USA, EU, etc.)
   - Product mix by sector
   - Seasonal variations
   - Value ranges

3. **Generate Simulated Shipments**
   - For each MATRADE company:
     - Assign realistic trade partners
     - Use actual product categories
     - Match historical volume/value patterns
     - Create monthly shipments (last 6-12 months)

**Expected Output:**
- 10,000-50,000 realistic shipment records
- Based on real Malaysia trade patterns
- Proper product-destination matching
- Credible value distributions

---

### **Phase 3: Risk Scoring Enhancement** (Week 3)

**Goal:** Use trade statistics for baseline anomaly detection

**Steps:**
1. **Build Baseline Models**
   - Normal price ranges by product/destination
   - Expected trade routes by sector
   - Typical transaction sizes

2. **Implement Anomaly Detection**
   - Flag shipments deviating >2œÉ from norms
   - Detect unusual destination changes
   - Identify value over/under-invoicing patterns

3. **Risk Score Calculation**
   - Low risk: Within 1œÉ of historical patterns
   - Medium risk: 1-2œÉ deviation
   - High risk: >2œÉ deviation
   - Critical: Suspicious destinations + value anomalies

**Expected Output:**
- Intelligent risk scoring system
- Based on real trade data
- Automated anomaly flagging
- Dashboard alerts with context

**Legal:** Public domain government data - safe for commercial use

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Update Frequency:** Unknown - check individual datasets for last update
2. **Format:** CSV/Excel (no live API) - requires batch downloads
3. **Completeness:** May not include all Malaysian companies (only MATRADE-registered)
