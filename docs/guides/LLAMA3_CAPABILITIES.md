## üìä Current Limitations in TradeNest

### 1. **No Access to Your Database** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Llama 3 doesn't automatically know about:
- Your specific companies
- Your alerts and anomalies
- Your shipment data
- Your custom rules

**Unless you include it in the prompt!**

**How it works now:**
```typescript
// Current AI chat sends user question ONLY
prompt: query

// Should include database context:
prompt: query + context from database
```

### 2. **Limited TradeNest-Specific Knowledge** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Llama 3 doesn't know:
- Your specific products/categories
- Your anomaly thresholds
- Your internal processes
- Your Malaysian trade partners

**This is why we discussed adding a knowledge base!**

### 3. **No Real-Time Data** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Llama 3's knowledge is from training (up to April 2024):
- Can't access live market data
- Can't check current prices
- Can't access external APIs
- Can't browse the internet

### 4. **Context Window Limit** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **8,000 tokens** maximum per conversation
- ‚âà 6,000 words
- Can't analyze extremely large datasets in one prompt

## üéØ What Users CAN Ask (Right Now)

### ‚úÖ General Questions (Works Great!)
```
"What is trade-based money laundering?"
"What are FATF guidelines?"
"Explain HS code classification"
"How does customs valuation work?"
"What are anti-dumping measures?"
```

### ‚úÖ Technical Explanations (Works Great!)
```
"Explain Z-score in anomaly detection"
"What is circular trading?"
"How do trade remedies work?"
"What is phantom shipping?"
```

### ‚úÖ Analysis & Reasoning (Works Great!)
```
"Which industries have highest money laundering risk?"
"What are red flags for over-invoicing?"
"How should I investigate suspicious shipments?"
"Compare different compliance frameworks"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data-Specific Questions (Limited)
```
"Analyze the companies in our database"
  ‚Üí AI responds generally, not with YOUR data

"What anomalies do we have?"
  ‚Üí AI doesn't know about YOUR anomalies

"Which of our shipments are suspicious?"
  ‚Üí AI needs the data in the prompt
```

---

## üöÄ How to Add Database Context (Enhancement)

### Current State:
```typescript
// app/api/ai/chat/route.ts
// Only sends the user's question
prompt: query
```

### Enhanced Version:
```typescript
// app/api/ai/chat/route.ts
// Fetches database data and includes it

const context = await fetchDatabaseContext(query);

prompt: `
Database Context:
- Companies: ${companies.length}
- Alerts: ${alerts.length}
- Shipments: ${shipments.length}

User Question: ${query}

Data:
${JSON.stringify(context)}
`
```

### This Enables:
```
"Analyze the FMM companies in our database"
  ‚Üí AI gets actual company data from database

"What are the recent anomalies?"
  ‚Üí AI gets actual anomaly data

"Which shipments look suspicious?"
  ‚Üí AI gets actual shipment data
```

---

## üß† Adding Knowledge Base (We Discussed This!)

### Current State:
- Llama 3 uses general knowledge only
- No domain-specific expertise

### With Knowledge Base:
```typescript
// Add TBML patterns, regulations, HS codes, etc.
const knowledgeBase = {
  tbmlPatterns: { /* ... */ },
  malaysianRegulations: { /* ... */ },
  hsCodes: { /* ... */ },
};

prompt: userQuery + relevantKnowledge + databaseContext
```

### This Enables:
```
"What are Malaysian trade regulations?"
  ‚Üí AI cites specific regulations from knowledge base

"Is HS code 7214.20 high risk for TBML?"
  ‚Üí AI references HS code intelligence

"What red flags should I look for in steel imports?"
  ‚Üí AI uses industry-specific patterns
```

## üí° Best Practices for Users

### ‚úÖ Ask Open-Ended Questions:
- "What should I look for in suspicious shipments?"
- "How do I identify trade-based money laundering?"
- "What are best practices for compliance?"

### ‚úÖ Ask About Data When Available:
- "Explain this alert: [include alert details]"
- "Analyze this company: [include company data]"
- "Why is this suspicious: [include shipment data]"

### ‚úÖ Ask General Trade/Compliance Questions:
- "What is the WTO dispute resolution process?"
- "Explain Malaysian anti-dumping regulations"
- "How do I calculate customs duties?"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't Assume AI Knows YOUR Data:
- ‚ùå "Which companies in our database are risky?"
  - AI doesn't have access (unless you include it)
- ‚úÖ "Given these companies [paste data], which are risky?"
  - AI can analyze if you provide the data

---

## üéØ Summary

### What Llama 3 CAN Do:
- ‚úÖ Answer general knowledge questions
- ‚úÖ Explain technical concepts
- ‚úÖ Analyze data you provide
- ‚úÖ Reason about trade compliance
- ‚úÖ Provide recommendations
- ‚úÖ Understand complex queries

### What Llama 3 CANNOT Do (Without Your Help):
- ‚ùå Access your database automatically
- ‚ùå Know your specific companies/agents
- ‚ùå Know your custom rules
- ‚ùå Access real-time market data
- ‚ùå Know your organization's policies

### How to Bridge the Gap:
1. **Include database context** in prompts (easy to add)
2. **Add knowledge base** with TBML patterns (we discussed)
3. **Fetch relevant data** based on user query
4. **Provide examples** in system prompt

---

## üîß Want to Add Database Context?

I can update the AI chat to automatically fetch and include:
- Company data when users ask about companies
- Alert data when users ask about alerts
- Shipment data when users ask about shipments
- Anomaly data when users ask about anomalies

This would make AI responses much more relevant to your actual data!
