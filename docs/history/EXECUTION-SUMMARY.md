## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Once Scraper Finishes):

1. **Run Transformation**
   ```bash
   cd scripts/scraper
   npm run transform
   ```

2. **Review Generated Data**
   - Check `lib/mock-data/fmm-companies-scraped.ts`
   - Verify company count
   - Review sector distribution

3. **Seed Database**
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   npm run seed-db
   ```

4. **Verify Dashboard**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Check company listings
   - Test filters (sector, type)
   - Verify drill-down works

### Short-term (Trade Data):

**Option A: Simulated Data (Fastest for Demo)**
- Generate realistic shipment data
- Based on company sectors and sizes
- Use actual HS codes from products table
- Match Malaysia trade patterns

**Option B: Real Trade Data**

- Port authority data exports
- Commercial databases (Panjiva, ImportGenius)

### For Demo Presentation:

**Data Preparation:**
- ‚úÖ 300-500+ real company names
- ‚è≥ Simulated trade transactions
- ‚è≥ Risk scoring based on patterns
- ‚è≥ Geographic distribution charts

**Talking Points:**
- "Real FMM members - our target market"
- "500+ potential subscribers"
- "Nationwide coverage across all states"
- "Multi-sector reach (electronics, steel, chemicals, etc.)"
