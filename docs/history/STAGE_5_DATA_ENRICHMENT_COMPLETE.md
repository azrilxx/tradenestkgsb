## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Task 5.1: External Data Enrichment
**File:** `lib/enrichment/data-enricher.ts`

Implemented comprehensive external data enrichment system:

**Key Features:**

1. **Company Profile Enrichment**
   - Revenue data
   - Employee count
   - Sector rank
   - Headquarters location
   - Established year
   - Website information

2. **News Sentiment Analysis**
   - Sentiment score (-1 to 1)
   - Article count
   - Recent articles with:
     - Title
     - URL
     - Published date
     - Sentiment score

3. **Market Context**
   - Sector trend (Growing/Stable/Declining/Volatile/Emerging)
   - Competitive landscape analysis
   - Market size estimates
   - Growth rate projections

4. **Economic Indicators**
   - GDP correlation
   - Inflation impact
   - Sector GDP share
   - Export contribution

**Functions Implemented:**
```typescript
- enrichAlertContext() - Main enrichment function
- enrichCompanyProfile() - Company data
- enrichNewsSentiment() - News analysis
- enrichMarketContext() - Market data
- enrichEconomicIndicators() - Economic data
- enrichMultipleAlerts() - Batch enrichment
- getEnrichedIntelligenceReport() - Complete report
```

**Data Sources:**
- Company database (existing companies table)
- Simulated news data (ready for integration with news APIs)
- Simulated economic data (ready for integration with economic data APIs)
- Market research data (simulated sector trends)

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { enrichAlertContext } from '@/lib/enrichment/data-enricher';

const enriched = await enrichAlertContext(alertId, companyId, productId);
// Returns: company_profile, news_sentiment, market_context, economic_indicators
```

### ✅ Task 5.2: Benchmark Integration
**File:** `lib/analytics/benchmark-integration.ts`

Implemented comprehensive benchmark comparison system:

**Key Features:**

1. **Industry Average Metrics**
   - Industry average cascade impact: 35%
   - Industry average risk score: 45
   - Percentile ranking (0-100)
   - Sector comparison

2. **Percentile Calculation**
   - Cascade impact percentiles
   - Risk score percentiles
   - Combined overall percentile
   - Statistical distribution analysis

3. **Sector Comparison**
   - Steel Manufacturing: 42%
   - Chemical Processing: 38%
   - Food & Beverage: 28%
   - Textiles: 32%
   - Electronics: 35%
   - Automotive: 45%
   - General: 35%

4. **Historical Event Matching**
   - Similar cascade events
   - Historical outcomes
   - Date and impact data
   - Outcome descriptions

**Functions Implemented:**
```typescript
- getBenchmarkMetrics() - Main benchmark calculation
- calculatePercentile() - Percentile calculation
- getSectorComparison() - Sector-specific metrics
- findSimilarHistoricalEvents() - Historical matching
- getEnhancedInterconnectedIntelligence() - Enhanced intelligence
```

**Benchmark Metrics:**
- Industry averages for comparison
- Percentile rankings (distribution-based)
- Sector-specific comparisons
- Historical event matching
- Difference calculations

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { getEnhancedInterconnectedIntelligence } from '@/lib/analytics/benchmark-integration';

const enhanced = await getEnhancedInterconnectedIntelligence(alertId, 30);
// Returns: intelligence + benchmarks
```

## Integration Points

### Enrichment Integration

**With Intelligence Dashboard:**
- Show company profile in alert details
- Display news sentiment
- Show market context
- Include economic indicators

**With API Endpoints:**
- `/api/analytics/connections/[alertId]` - Add enriched context
- New endpoint: `/api/enrichment/[alertId]` - Get enrichment data

### Benchmark Integration

**With Intelligence Dashboard:**
- Display percentile rankings
- Show sector comparison
- Display industry averages
- Show historical events

**With API Endpoints:**
- Enhanced intelligence endpoint
- Benchmark comparison endpoint
- Historical events API

## Usage Examples

### Enrichment
```typescript
import { enrichAlertContext } from '@/lib/enrichment/data-enricher';

const enriched = await enrichAlertContext(alertId, companyId, productId);

console.log('Company revenue:', enriched.company_profile?.revenue);
console.log('News sentiment:', enriched.news_sentiment?.score);
console.log('Market trend:', enriched.market_context?.sector_trend);
console.log('GDP correlation:', enriched.economic_indicators?.gdp_correlation);
```

### Benchmark
```typescript
import { getBenchmarkMetrics } from '@/lib/analytics/benchmark-integration';

const benchmarks = await getBenchmarkMetrics(cascadeImpact, riskScore, 'steel_manufacturing');

console.log('Percentile:', benchmarks.percentile_ranking);
console.log('Industry avg:', benchmarks.industry_average_cascade_impact);
console.log('Sector avg:', benchmarks.sector_comparison.average_cascade);
console.log('Historical events:', benchmarks.similar_historical_events);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Enrichment
- Parallel API calls (Promise.all)
- Efficient database queries
- Caching opportunities for company data
- Rate limiting for external APIs

### Benchmarks
- Lightweight calculations
- No external API calls
- Fast percentile calculation
- Efficient sector lookup

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `lib/enrichment/data-enricher.ts` (400+ lines)
- `lib/analytics/benchmark-integration.ts` (200+ lines)

**Total:** ~600 lines of new enrichment and benchmark code

## Next Steps (Stage 6)

1. Enhanced PDF reports with enriched data
2. Batch analysis API
3. Export endpoints
4. Excel export
5. Scheduled reports
