## üéØ UPDATED BUILD PRIORITY

### Recommended Order:

1. Gazette Tracker - Unique IP
2. Trade Remedy Workbench - High-value revenue

**Week 5 (Days 26-32):** Scale via Associations
3. FMM Association Portal - Access to 3,000 companies
4. Customs Declaration Checker - Additional revenue

**Later:** Custom Rule Builder (low priority)

## üí∞ REVENUE IMPACT

### With Phase 7:
- **Evidence packs:** 3 cases @ RM 50k = **RM 150k/year**
- **FMM partnership:** RM 150k/year (3,000 companies)
- **Law firms:** 3 firms @ RM 10k/month = **RM 360k/year**
- **Individual subscriptions:** 20 companies @ RM 4,500/month = **RM 1.08M/year**

**Total Year 1: RM 1.74M** (vs generic platform: RM 2.7M but harder to sell)

### Why This Is Better:
- ‚úÖ Multiple revenue streams
- ‚úÖ Higher ticket sizes (RM 50k vs RM 4,500)
- ‚úÖ Easier to sell (clear pain point)
- ‚úÖ FMM partnership = instant scale
