**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Implementation:** All Stage 3 visualization components completed

---

## Overview

Stage 3 successfully implements interactive visualizations for the Interconnected Intelligence module, transforming it from a basic list view into a rich, multi-view dashboard with network graphs and animated cascade flows.

---

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Task 3.1: Visualization Libraries Installed
**Status:** Already completed in previous stages

Libraries previously installed:
- `react-force-graph-2d` - Force-directed graph visualization
- `cytoscape` - Advanced graph layouts
- `cytoscape-cola` - Layout algorithms
- `d3-force` - Force simulation

---

### ✅ Task 3.2: Network Graph Component
**File:** `components/intelligence/network-graph.tsx`

Implemented interactive force-directed network graph visualization:

**Key Features:**
- Interactive force-directed graph layout
- Node sizing based on connection count
- Edge thickness proportional to correlation strength
- Color-coded nodes by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Click-to-select nodes with detail panel
- Hover tooltips showing node information
- Zoom and pan controls
- Legend explaining color schemes

**Visual Elements:**
- **Node Size:** 8px base + 2px per connection (up to 28px max)
- **Edge Thickness:** 1-4px based on correlation weight (0-1)
- **Edge Colors:**
  - Red: Strong correlation (≥0.7)
  - Orange: Moderate correlation (≥0.5)
  - Yellow: Weak correlation (<0.5)
- **Node Colors:**
  - Red: Critical severity
  - Orange: High severity
  - Yellow: Medium severity
  - Blue: Low severity

**Interactive Features:**
- Auto-fit on engine stop (400ms delay, 20px padding)
- Click handler for node selection
- Hover state detection
- Dynamic node labels with severity
- Progress bar and legend

**Empty State:**
- Graceful handling of no data
- Icon and message display

### ✅ Task 3.3: Enhanced Dashboard with Tabs
**File:** Updated `app/dashboard/intelligence/page.tsx`

Implemented comprehensive tabbed interface with four views:

**View Modes:**
1. **List View** - Traditional card-based layout (existing functionality)
2. **Graph View** - Interactive network graph visualization
3. **Timeline View** - Animated cascade flow visualization
4. **Matrix View** - Placeholder for correlation heatmap

**Key Enhancements:**
- Tab navigation with active state highlighting
- Smooth transitions between views
- Consistent data passing between views
- Impact metrics displayed above tabs
- Responsive layout with sidebar margin

**Layout Improvements:**
- Grid-based metric cards (4 columns)
- Enhanced visual hierarchy
- Better separation of concerns
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Data Preparation:**
- Graph data transformation from API response
- Cascade flow data transformation
- Proper node and edge structuring
- Correlation score mapping

### ✅ Task 3.4: Animated Cascade Flow
**File:** `components/intelligence/cascade-flow.tsx`

Implemented animated cascade flow visualization:

**Key Features:**
- Multi-level visualization (0 = primary, 1+ = hops)
- Animated propagation from primary to connected nodes
- Play/pause/reset controls
- Step-by-step progression (2 seconds per step)
- Progress bar with percentage
- Level grouping by hop count

**Animation Controls:**
- **Play Button:** Starts animation from current step
- **Pause Button:** Pauses animation at current step
- **Reset Button:** Returns to first step
- **Auto-play:** Optional automatic progression

**Visual Elements:**
- Level labels (Primary Alert, Hop 1, Hop 2, etc.)
- Node count per level
- Rightward arrows between levels
- Opacity transitions (30% for future, 100% for current)
- Pulse animation on active step

**Node Cards:**
- Severity badges
- Type names (human-readable)
- Timestamp display
- Correlation percentages
- Click-to-select functionality
- Hover scale effect

**Layout:**
- Horizontal flow layout
- Flexible node container sizing
- Automatic level detection
- Dynamic spacing
- Empty state handling

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

```
components/intelligence/
├── network-graph.tsx      # Force-directed graph visualization
└── cascade-flow.tsx       # Animated cascade propagation

app/dashboard/intelligence/
└── page.tsx                # Main dashboard with tabbed views
```

### Data Transformation

**NetworkGraph Preparation:**
```typescript
const getGraphData = () => {
  const nodes = [
    { id, type, severity, timestamp },
    ...connected_factors.map(factor => ({ id, type, severity, timestamp }))
  ];
  
  const edges = connected_factors.map(factor => ({
    source: primary_alert.id,
    target: factor.id,
    weight: factor.correlation_score || 0.5,
    type: 'correlation'
  }));
  
  return { nodes, edges };
};
```

**CascadeFlow Preparation:**
```typescript
const getCascadeData = () => {
  return [
    { id, type, severity, timestamp, label, level: 0 },
    ...connected_factors.map((factor, index) => ({
      id, type, severity, timestamp, label,
      level: 1,
      correlation: factor.correlation_score
    }))
  ];
};
```

- Node limits for scalability (current: ~100 nodes)
- Efficient edge rendering
- Smooth animations

### Data Processing
- Client-side transformation
- Minimal re-renders
- Efficient state management
- Lazy loading of graph component (SSR disabled)

### Animation
- 2-second interval for steps
- Efficient state updates
- Cleanup on unmount
- Optional autoplay
