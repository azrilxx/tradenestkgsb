# TradeNest AI Features - Ready for Demo

## What I Built with OpenRouter

I've created a complete AI-powered intelligence layer for TradeNest using OpenRouter. Here's everything that's ready:

---

## 🎯 AI Features Overview

### 1. **AI Assistant Chat Interface** ✨
**URL:** http://localhost:3005/ai-assistant (when running `npm run dev`)

**What it does:**
- Natural language chat about TBML patterns
- Analyzes companies in your database
- Explains money laundering techniques
- Provides compliance recommendations

**Example Questions You Can Ask:**
```
"Analyze the FMM companies in our database"
"What are the top TBML red flags to watch for?"
"Which Malaysian companies should we prioritize?"
"Explain high-risk sectors for money laundering"
```

**Features:**
- Real-time streaming responses (text appears as AI types)
- Context-aware (reads from your Supabase database)
- Quick question buttons for common queries
- Beautiful gradient UI design

---

### 2. **Alert Explanation API** 🔔
**Endpoint:** POST /api/ai/explain-alert

**What it does:**
Converts technical alerts into plain-language explanations for compliance officers.

**Example Request:**
```json
POST /api/ai/explain-alert
{
  "type": "Price Deviation",
  "severity": "high",
  "companyName": "004 International (MY) Sdn Bhd",
  "description": "Product priced 45% above market average",
  "shipmentDetails": {
    "product": "Fuel Oils",
    "declaredPrice": "$145/barrel",
    "marketAverage": "$100/barrel"
  }
}
```

**AI Response:**
```
"This alert was triggered because the declared price of Fuel Oils
($145/barrel) is 45% above market average ($100/barrel). This pattern
suggests potential trade-based value transfer, where overpricing is used
to move illicit funds across borders.

Red Flags:
- Significant price deviation from market norms
- High-value commodity (fuel oils) commonly used in TBML
- Chemicals sector has elevated risk

Recommended Actions:
1. Request commercial invoices and contracts
2. Verify pricing with independent commodity databases
3. Review past 12 months of similar shipments
4. Conduct enhanced due diligence on 004 International"
```

### 3. **Company Risk Analysis API** 📊
**Endpoint:** POST /api/ai/analyze-company

**What it does:**
Generates comprehensive TBML risk profiles for companies.

**Example Request:**
```json
POST /api/ai/analyze-company
{
  "name": "A W Faber-Castell (M) Sdn Bhd",
  "country": "Malaysia",
  "type": "exporter",
  "sector": "Manufacturing",
  "products": ["Writing Instruments", "Art Supplies"]
}
```

**AI Response:**
```
Overall Risk Score: LOW

Key Risk Factors:
+ Established international brand with legitimate business operations
+ Manufacturing sector is medium-risk (but lower for branded goods)
+ Malaysian jurisdiction has strong AML/CFT framework
- Exporter status requires monitoring for under-invoicing
- Multiple product lines create complexity in pricing validation

Risk Assessment:
The company presents low overall TBML risk due to brand reputation and
transparent operations. However, standard monitoring should include:

1. Invoice sampling for pricing consistency
2. Quarterly transaction pattern analysis
3. Verification of trade partner legitimacy
4. Review of unusual destination countries

Recommended Monitoring Approach: Standard quarterly review with
automated alerts for transactions >$100K or new high-risk jurisdictions.
```

### 4. **AI Chat with Database Context** 💬
**Endpoint:** POST /api/ai/chat

**What it does:**
Streaming chat responses with access to your TradeNest database.

**Special Features:**
- Streams responses in real-time (Server-Sent Events)
- Can query your Supabase database for context
- Remembers conversation context
- Cites specific companies/alerts from your data
