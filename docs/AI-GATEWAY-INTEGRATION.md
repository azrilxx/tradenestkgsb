# Vercel AI Gateway Integration for TradeNest

## Overview

Your Vercel AI Gateway API key (`vck_1coUG0soPCBLEyTbHBHSk9G0WzA68mTCMMCIF1DAOz746KphGD2bpZ6S`) enables AI-powered features in TradeNest.

## Important Note About the API Key

The key you provided starts with `vck_` which indicates it's a **Vercel AI Gateway key**. This type of key is used specifically for Vercel's AI infrastructure and requires special configuration.

### Two Options:

### Option 1: Use a Real OpenAI API Key (Recommended for Testing)

To test the AI features immediately, you need an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

The key should start with `sk-` (not `vck_`).

**Update `.env.local`:**
```bash
# Replace with your OpenAI key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
```

### Option 2: Configure Vercel AI Gateway Properly

If you want to use Vercel AI Gateway (for production), you need to:

1. Verify your Vercel AI Gateway configuration at: https://vercel.com/dashboard/ai
2. Get the correct gateway endpoint URL
3. Configure the baseURL in the OpenAI client

**The current issue:** The `vck_` key format suggests this is a Vercel token, but we need the actual OpenAI API key that Vercel AI Gateway wraps.

## What We Built

Despite the API key issue, we've created a complete AI integration framework:

### 1. AI Utility Library ([lib/ai.ts](lib/ai.ts))

```typescript
import { riskAnalyst } from '@/lib/ai';

// Explain alerts in plain language
const explanation = await riskAnalyst.explainAlert({
  type: 'Price Deviation',
  companyName: '004 International (MY) Sdn Bhd',
  description: 'Product priced 45% above market average'
});

// Analyze company risk profiles
const analysis = await riskAnalyst.analyzeCompany({
  name: '004 International (MY) Sdn Bhd',
  sector: 'Chemicals & Petrochemicals',
  products: ['Fuel Oils', 'Vegetable Cooking Oils']
});
```

### 2. API Routes

- **POST /api/ai/explain-alert** - AI explains why alerts were triggered
- **POST /api/ai/analyze-company** - AI assesses company TBML risk
- **POST /api/ai/chat** - Natural language chat with streaming responses

### 3. AI Assistant Page

Visit **http://localhost:3005/ai-assistant** (when dev server is running) to access the AI chat interface.

Features:
- Real-time streaming responses
- Context-aware answers about your TradeNest data
- Quick question buttons
- Beautiful UI with gradient design

## Use Cases for TradeNest

### 1. Alert Explanation
```javascript
// Frontend code
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/explain-alert', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'Unusual Volume',
    companyName: 'A W Faber-Castell (M) Sdn Bhd',
    description: 'Shipment volume 300% above historical average'
  })
});

// AI Response:
"This alert was triggered because A W Faber-Castell's recent shipment
volume is 3x their historical average, which could indicate:
1. Trade-based value transfer (layering illicit funds)
2. Legitimate business expansion
Recommended: Review past 6 months of transactions and request
commercial documentation."
```

### 2. Company Risk Analysis
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/analyze-company', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: '899 F&B Manufacturing Sdn Bhd',
    country: 'Malaysia',
    sector: 'Food & Beverage',
    type: 'exporter'
  })
});

// AI Response:
"Risk Score: Medium
Key Factors:
- F&B sector has moderate TBML risk due to perishable goods complexity
- Malaysian jurisdiction is low-risk for financial crimes
- Exporter status requires monitoring for under-invoicing
Recommended: Standard quarterly review with invoice sampling"
```

### 3. Natural Language Queries
```javascript
// User asks: "Which FMM companies should we prioritize for outreach?"

// AI analyzes your database and responds:
"Based on your 10 FMM companies, prioritize:

1. **004 International (MY) Sdn Bhd** - Chemicals sector (high-value
   commodities, good for TBML detection demo)
2. **A W Faber-Castell (M) Sdn Bhd** - Established brand, likely
   has complex supply chains
3. **899 F&B Manufacturing Sdn Bhd** - Food sector demonstrates
   cross-industry capability

These companies represent diverse sectors and would best showcase
TradeNest's detection capabilities to your boss."
```

## Next Steps to Make It Work

### Quick Fix (for immediate testing):

1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Update `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key
   ```
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Run test script: `node scripts/test-ai.mjs`
5. Visit http://localhost:3005/ai-assistant

### For Production (using Vercel AI Gateway):

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → AI
2. Find your AI Gateway configuration
3. Get the actual OpenAI API key (not the Vercel token)
4. Update configuration with proper endpoint

## Benefits Once Working

### For Your Boss Demo:

1. **"Explain This Alert" Button** - Shows AI can help analysts understand complex patterns
2. **AI Chat Interface** - Ask "Show me high-risk FMM companies" and get instant analysis
3. **Automated Risk Scoring** - Bulk analyze all 70 companies in database
4. **Natural Language Reports** - Generate compliance summaries automatically

### Technical Benefits:

- **Cost Optimization**: Vercel AI Gateway caches repeated queries
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API quota exhaustion
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic failover between providers
- **Analytics**: Track AI usage per feature
