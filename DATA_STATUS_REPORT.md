## ❌ Missing Database Tables

These tables exist in migrations but **NOT in your Supabase database**:

### Critical Tables (Needed for Full Demo):

1. **`custom_rules`** - Custom anomaly detection rules
   - Error: `Could not find the table 'public.custom_rules' in the schema cache`
   - Impact: Rules Builder page won't work
   - Data ready: 18 sample rules in code

2. **`rule_executions`** - Rule execution history
   - Error: Same schema cache error
   - Impact: Can't show rule performance
   - Data ready: Execution logs generator exists

3. **`user_subscriptions`** - Subscription tier management
   - Error: `Could not find the table 'public.user_subscriptions'`
   - Impact: Feature gating won't work
   - Data ready: Subscription generator exists

4. **`intelligence_analysis_usage`** - Intelligence usage tracking
   - Error: `Could not find the table 'public.intelligence_analysis_usage'`
   - Impact: Usage monitoring won't work
   - Data ready: Usage generator exists

### Schema Mismatches:

5. **`fx_rates`** table - Missing `currency_pair` column
   - Error: `Could not find the 'currency_pair' column`
   - Actual column might be named differently

6. **`shipments`** table - Missing `arrival_date` column
   - Error: `Could not find the 'arrival_date' column`
   - Some shipments missing arrival dates

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Your **migration files exist** in `supabase/migrations/` but they were **never applied** to your Supabase database:

```
✅ migrations/003_custom_rules_schema.sql - NOT APPLIED
✅ migrations/007_subscription_tiers.sql - NOT APPLIED
✅ migrations/008_intelligence_webhooks.sql - NOT APPLIED
```

This is why the seed script shows 0 for these tables - they literally don't exist in the database yet.

---

## 🚨 Action Required: Apply Missing Migrations

### Option 1: Use Supabase CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if needed
npm install -g supabase

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref fckszlhkvdnrvgsjymgs

# Apply all pending migrations
supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution

Run these migrations in Supabase SQL Editor one by one:

1. **Custom Rules Schema**
   File: `supabase/migrations/003_custom_rules_schema.sql`

2. **Subscription Tiers**
   File: `supabase/migrations/007_subscription_tiers.sql`

3. **Intelligence & Usage Tracking**
   File: `supabase/migrations/008_intelligence_webhooks.sql`

**URL**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fckszlhkvdnrvgsjymgs/sql/new

## 📋 Post-Migration: Re-Seed Data

After applying migrations, re-run the seed to populate the new tables:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/seed -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"action\": \"clear\"}"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/seed -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"action\": \"seed\"}"
```

Expected result after re-seed:
```json
{
  "anomalies": 100,
  "alerts": 100,
  "customRules": 18,        // ← Should be > 0
  "ruleExecutions": 30,     // ← Should be > 0
  "subscriptions": 1,       // ← Should be > 0
  "intelligenceUsage": 20   // ← Should be > 0
}
```

## 🎬 Ready for Demo?

### Current State: **75% Ready**

✅ **Can Demo Now**:
- Dashboard with 100 alerts
- Trade intelligence with 2,000 shipments
- Anomaly detection & analysis
- Historical charts & trends

❌ **Missing for Full Demo**:
- Custom Rules Builder (needs migration)

2. Re-run seed script (5 min)
3. Verify all features (5 min)

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Apply Missing Migrations** (PRIORITY 1)
   - Run migrations 003, 007, 008
   - This unlocks the remaining 25% of features

2. **Re-seed Database** (PRIORITY 2)
   - Clear old data
   - Seed with all tables available
   - Verify custom rules, subscriptions, usage appear

3. **Test All Features** (PRIORITY 3)
   - Browse alerts
   - Check custom rules page
   - Verify intelligence analysis
   - Test subscription gating

4. **Optional: Add More Data**
   - Increase anomalies to 200+ for longer history
   - Add more shipments for deeper analytics
   - Create gazette data (trade remedies)

---

## 💡 Bottom Line

**You have excellent, realistic data** for the core TradeNest features. The only blocker is that **3 database tables haven't been created yet** because migrations weren't applied.

Once you apply the missing migrations (15 min task), you'll have a **fully functional TradeNest** with:
- 100 anomalies & alerts
- 2,000 shipment transactions
- 18 custom rules
- Subscription management
- Usage tracking
