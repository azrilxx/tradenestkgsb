## 🚀 Next Steps (After Download Completes)

### Step 1: Check Download Status

```bash
cd scripts/matrade-importer

# Check if download completed
ls downloads/
# Should see: ee-parts.csv, palm-oil.csv, automotive.csv, etc.
```

### Step 2: Parse Datasets

```bash
npm run parse
```

**Expected Output:**
- Extracts company names, addresses, contacts
- Deduplicates across datasets
- Saves to `output/parsed-companies.json`

### Step 3: Transform to TradeNest Format

```bash
npm run transform
```

**Expected Output:**
- Maps to database schema
- Categorizes by sector
- Generates `lib/mock-data/matrade-companies.ts`

### Step 4: Update Seed Script

Edit `lib/mock-data/seed.ts`:

```typescript
// Add this import at the top
import { MATRADE_COMPANIES } from './matrade-companies';

// Update the companies array (around line 50)
const allCompanies = [
  ...FMM_COMPANIES,
  ...scrapedCompaniesForDB,
  ...MATRADE_COMPANIES.map(c => ({
    name: c.name,
    country: c.country,
    type: c.type,
    sector: c.sector
  }))
];
```

### Step 5: Seed Database

```bash
cd ../..  # Back to project root
node scripts/seed-fmm-direct.mjs
```

Or if using the API endpoint:
```bash
npm run seed-db
```

### Step 6: Verify

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3002
# Check company listings - should now show 1,000s of companies!
```
