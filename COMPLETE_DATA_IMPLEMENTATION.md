# Complete Data Requirements Implementation

## Summary

Successfully enhanced TradeNest database to include comprehensive demo data required for full AI assistant functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Anomaly Generation (Priority 1) ✅
**File**: `lib/mock-data/generators.ts`

- Modified `generateDemoAnomalies()` to accept count parameter (default 100)
- Generates 100+ diverse anomalies with:
  - All 4 types: `price_spike`, `tariff_change`, `freight_surge`, `fx_volatility`
  - All 4 severities: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
  - Time distribution: Past 90 days (not just 10)
  - Product diversity: 10 categories × multiple products each
  - Realistic variation in z-scores, percentages, and thresholds

**File**: `lib/mock-data/seed.ts`

- Updated to call `generateDemoAnomalies(100)` instead of `generateDemoAnomalies()`
- Now generates 100 anomalies instead of 10

### 2. Custom Rules & Execution Data (Priority 2) ✅
**File**: `lib/mock-data/custom-rules.ts` (NEW)

- Created 18 sample custom rules including:
  - Price Spike >50% in Electronics
  - Sudden Volume Surge
  - High-Risk Jurisdiction Trade
  - FX Volatility MYR/USD
  - Dual-Use Products Export
  - Cross-Border Arbitrage
  - Supply Chain Disruption
  - And 11 more diverse rules
  
- Implemented `generateRuleExecutions()` function
- Generates 3-7 execution records per rule
- Includes mix of matched/unmatched results
- Tracks performance metrics: matches found, anomalies created, execution time

### 3. Subscription & Usage Tracking (Priority 3) ✅
**File**: `lib/mock-data/subscriptions.ts` (NEW)

- Created `generateSubscriptions()` function
- Generates Professional tier demo subscription
- Includes features and usage limits
- 90-day history

- Created `generateIntelligenceUsage()` function
- Generates 55+ intelligence analysis usage records
- Types: connection_analysis, multi_hop_analysis, temporal_analysis, cascade_prediction
- Distributed over past 30 days
- Links to actual alert IDs

### 4. Type Definitions ✅
**File**: `types/database.ts`

- Added `SubscriptionTier` type: `'free' | 'professional' | 'enterprise'`
- Added `UserSubscription` interface with:
  - user_id, tier, features, usage_limits, started_at, expires_at, is_active
- Added `IntelligenceAnalysisUsage` interface with:
  - user_id, alert_id, analysis_type, time_window, metadata

Note: `CustomRule` and `RuleExecution` types were already present in the database file.

### 5. Seed Script Integration ✅
**File**: `lib/mock-data/seed.ts`

Added 4 new seeding steps:
- **Step 7**: Increased shipments from 800 to 2000
- **Step 9**: Insert custom rules (18 rules)
- **Step 10**: Insert rule executions (50+ executions)
- **Step 11**: Insert user subscriptions (Professional tier)
- **Step 12**: Insert intelligence usage data (55+ records)

Updated summary output to include:
- Custom rules count
- Rule executions count
- Subscriptions count
- Intelligence usage count

### 6. Database Schema Verification ✅
**Files**: `supabase/migrations/`

Verified existing migrations:
- `003_custom_rules_schema.sql` - Custom rules and executions ✅
- `007_subscription_tiers.sql` - User subscriptions and intelligence usage ✅

No new migrations needed - tables already exist with proper schema.

## Files Modified

1. `lib/mock-data/generators.ts` - Enhanced anomaly generation
2. `lib/mock-data/seed.ts` - Integrated all new seeding
3. `types/database.ts` - Added missing type definitions
4. `lib/mock-data/custom-rules.ts` (NEW)
5. `lib/mock-data/subscriptions.ts` (NEW)

## How to Run

### Option 1: Via API Endpoint
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal or via API client
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "seed"}'
```

### Option 2: Via Seed Script (needs TypeScript support)
```bash
node scripts/seed.js
```

## Expected Results

After running the seed script, you'll have:

| Data Type | Before | After | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Anomalies** | 10 | 100+ | Diverse alert patterns |
| **Alerts** | 10 | 100+ | Alert management |
| **Shipments** | 800 | 2000+ | Trade intelligence |
| **Custom Rules** | 0 | 18 | Rule builder demo |
| **Rule Executions** | 0 | 50+ | Rule performance tracking |
| **Subscriptions** | 0 | 1 | Feature gating |
| **Intelligence Usage** | 0 | 55+ | Usage analytics |

   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the seed script** using the API endpoint (`POST /api/seed`)
2. **Verify data** by checking database tables:
   - Should have 100+ anomalies
   - Should have 2000+ shipments
   - Should have 18 custom rules
   - Should have 55+ intelligence usage records
3. **Test AI features** with various queries
4. **Check dashboard** for alert diversity
5. **Demonstrate features** to stakeholders

## Remaining Items Check

**Status**: All priorities from the data requirements document have been implemented!

## Technical Details

### Anomaly Generation Algorithm
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  const type = randomType();           // 4 types
  const severity = randomSeverity();  // 4 severities
  const daysAgo = randomInt(1, 90);    // Past 90 days
  const category = randomCategory();   // 10 categories
  // Generate realistic values based on severity
}
```

### Custom Rules Distribution
- 12 Active rules (demonstrates monitoring)
- 6 Inactive rules (shows configuration options)
- Covers: Price, Volume, Geography, Time, Compliance, Risk

### Intelligence Usage Distribution
- 55 records over 30 days
- ~2 uses per day average
- Mix of all analysis types
- Realistic time windows (7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days)

## Success Criteria

✅ Generate 100+ diverse anomalies  
✅ Create 18 custom rules with execution history  
✅ Add subscription data for feature gating  
✅ Track intelligence usage  
✅ Enable AI to explain all alert types  
✅ Provide context for pattern analysis  
✅ Demonstrate custom rule effectiveness
