### 2. Security Fixes Applied

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Delete Old Key

You still need to manually delete the OLD exposed key from OpenRouter:

1. **Go to**: https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. **Log in** to your account
3. **Find** the OLD key: `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`
4. **Click Delete** to remove it

This prevents anyone from using it even though it's exposed in git history.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables (For Deployment)

Your Vercel deployment needs the new key:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `tradenest` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Find or add `OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. Update value to: `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`
6. Redeploy your project

### 2. Test the New Key Locally

```bash
# Restart your dev server
npm run dev

# Visit the AI assistant
http://localhost:3005/ai-assistant

# Try asking a question to verify the new key works
```

### 3. Apply Supabase Migrations (If Not Done)

You still need to apply the 3 new database migrations:

1. Go to: https://fckszlhkvdnrvgsjymgs.supabase.co
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run migrations in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/004_gazette_tracker_schema.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/005_trade_remedy_schema.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/006_fmm_association_schema.sql`

See `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed instructions.
