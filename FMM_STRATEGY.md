## 🎯 Target Sectors & Use Cases

### Primary Sector: Steel & Metals (12 companies in demo)
**Pain Points:**
- **China dumping:** Steel imports priced 30-50% below market (anti-dumping duty evasion)
- **Origin manipulation:** Chinese steel routed through Vietnam/Thailand to avoid tariffs
- **Under-invoicing:** Suppliers declare lower values to reduce import duties

**TradeNest Solution:**
- Real-time price anomaly detection (Z-score > 2.0 triggers alert)
- Benchmark comparison: "Your price is 42% below market average"
- PDF evidence export for Malaysia Customs submission

**Demo Narrative:**
> "MegaSteel Industries Sdn Bhd imports flat-rolled steel from Shanghai. TradeNest detected a **42% price deviation** from market benchmarks, flagging potential anti-dumping duty evasion. Evidence PDF submitted to customs prevented RM 2.3M in penalties."

---

### High-Value Sector: Electronics & Electrical (15 companies)
**Pain Points:**
- **Singapore re-routing:** Goods routed through Singapore to claim CPTPP/RCEP benefits
- **Tariff classification fraud:** Misclassifying HS codes to reduce duties
- **Transfer pricing abuse:** Related-party transactions at manipulated prices

**TradeNest Solution:**
- Trade route mapping (origin → transit → destination)
- HS code correlation with pricing patterns
- Company drill-down: view full shipment history per supplier

**Demo Narrative:**
> "TechCom Solutions Sdn Bhd sources integrated circuits. TradeNest identified a **tariff avoidance pattern**: identical chips from China routed through Singapore at +15% markup but claiming lower CPTPP tariff rates."

---

### Complex Sector: Chemicals & Petrochemicals (12 companies)
**Pain Points:**
- **Price volatility:** Hard to distinguish fraud from market fluctuations
- **TBML risk:** Chemical trades used for money laundering (over/under-invoicing)

**TradeNest Solution:**
- Multi-factor detection: price + freight + FX correlation
- Custom rule builder: "Alert if price drops 30% AND freight spikes 25%"
- Benchmark analytics: industry average pricing per HS code

**Demo Narrative:**
> "PetroChemAsia Sdn Bhd imports polymers. TradeNest flagged a **TBML red flag**: polymer price dropped 30% while freight costs increased 25% on the same route—classic price-freight mismatch indicator."

---

### Other Sectors (F&B, Textiles, Automotive)
Each sector has tailored use cases in Phase 6 demo data:
- **F&B:** Volume surge detection during tariff change windows
