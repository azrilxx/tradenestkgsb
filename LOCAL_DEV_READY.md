## ⚠️ One Last Step: Confirm Demo User Email

The demo user exists but can't login yet because the email isn't confirmed.

### Quick Fix (Choose One):

#### Option 1: Manually Confirm the User (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/fckszlhkvdnrvgsjymgs/auth/users
2. Find user: `test@tradenest.com`
3. Click on the user
4. Click "Confirm email" or similar button
5. Done! User can now login

#### Option 2: Disable Email Confirmation (For Development)
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/fckszlhkvdnrvgsjymgs/auth/providers
2. Find "Email" section
3. Toggle "Enable email confirmations" to **OFF**
4. Click "Save"
5. Done! All users can login immediately

See detailed instructions in: [DISABLE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION.md](DISABLE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION.md)
