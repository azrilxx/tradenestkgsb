# How to Get Your Real Supabase Anon Key

## The Problem

The current `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your `.env.local` file is invalid or truncated. It ends with `...JZ7yJZ7yJZ7yJZ7` which looks like placeholder text.

## How to Get the Correct Key

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Visit: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project: **fckszlhkvdnrvgsjymgs**

### Step 2: Navigate to API Settings
1. Click the **Settings** icon (⚙️) in the left sidebar
2. Click **API** under "Project Settings"

### Step 3: Copy the Anon/Public Key
1. Scroll down to "Project API keys" section
2. Find the **anon** key (also labeled as "public")
3. Click the **Copy** button next to it
4. The key should start with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.`
5. The full key should be around **350-400 characters long**

### Step 4: Update .env.local File

Replace the current key in your `.env.local` file with the correct one:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZja3N6bGhrdmRucnZnc2p5bWdzIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzQ0ODIyMzIsImV4cCI6MjA1MDA1ODIzMn0.[THE_REST_OF_YOUR_REAL_KEY]
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to copy the ENTIRE key - it's quite long!

## What a Valid Key Looks Like

A valid Supabase anon key has 3 parts separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Header**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`
2. **Payload**: Long base64 string containing project info
3. **Signature**: Another base64 string for verification

Example structure:
```
eyJhbGci...  .  eyJpc3MiOiJz...  .  SflKxwRJ...
   ↑              ↑                    ↑
 Header         Payload            Signature
```

The entire key should be **350-400+ characters long**.

## After Getting the Key

1. Update `.env.local` with the correct key
2. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Test the connection:
   ```bash
   node test-supabase.js
   ```
4. You should see: `✅ Supabase connection successful!`

## Security Note

⚠️ **Never commit the `.env.local` file to Git!**

The anon key is public and safe to expose in client-side code, but it's still best practice to keep it in environment variables.
