# Security Fix: OpenRouter API Key Exposure

**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and committed

---

## Issue

OpenRouter API key was exposed in documentation files that were committed to GitHub. The key was visible in multiple markdown files.

**Exposed Key Pattern**: `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`

## Actions Taken

### 1. ✅ Removed Exposed Keys from All Files
- `docs/guides/AI-GATEWAY-INTEGRATION.md` - Replaced with placeholder
- `docs/planning/OPENROUTER-INTEGRATION.md` - Replaced with placeholder  
- `docs/planning/AI-FEATURES-DEMO.md` - Replaced with placeholder
- `lib/ai.ts` - Updated comment to generic reference

### 2. ✅ Enhanced .gitignore
Added comprehensive rules to prevent future exposure:
- Explicit `.env.local` exclusions
- All environment file patterns
- Secret file patterns (`*.key`, `*.pem`)
- IDE settings directories

### 3. ✅ Verified No .env Files in Git
Confirmed that no environment files are tracked in git repository.

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **REVOKE THE EXPOSED KEY** 
   - Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Find and revoke the exposed key: `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`
   - Generate a new key

### Setup New Key
2. **Create New `.env.local` File**
   ```bash
   # In project root
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_OPENROUTER_KEY_HERE
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3005
   ```

3. **Verify .env.local is NOT tracked**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should NOT show .env.local
   ```

### Production Deployment
4. **Add Key to Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with new value
   - Redeploy if needed

## Prevention Measures

### Already Implemented ✅
- ✅ `.gitignore` enhanced with comprehensive exclusions
- ✅ All documentation updated to use placeholders
- ✅ Comments updated to avoid key references

### Best Practices Going Forward
- ✅ Never commit API keys to git
- ✅ Always use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Use placeholders in documentation
- ✅ Regularly audit git history for sensitive data
- ✅ Use git secrets scanner if needed

## Files Changed

1. `docs/guides/AI-GATEWAY-INTEGRATION.md` - Removed key, added placeholder
2. `docs/planning/OPENROUTER-INTEGRATION.md` - Removed key, added placeholder
3. `docs/planning/AI-FEATURES-DEMO.md` - Removed key, added placeholder
4. `lib/ai.ts` - Updated comment to be generic
5. `.gitignore` - Enhanced with comprehensive exclusions

## Verification

After revoking and replacing the key, verify:

```bash
# Check no sensitive files are tracked
git ls-files | grep env
# Should return nothing

# Check gitignore is working
git check-ignore .env.local
# Should return: .env.local
```

## Timeline

- **Issue Discovered**: Email notification
- **Fix Applied**: Immediate removal of exposed keys
- **Push Complete**: All fixes committed and pushed
- **Next Step**: YOU need to revoke the old key and generate a new one

---

**Remember**: The old key is now in git history. After revoking it and generating a new one, the security issue is resolved for future use.
